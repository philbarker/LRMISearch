	<h1>LRMI Search</h1>
  <p><strong>Search Google and then filter the results to see which sites use LRMI properties in schema.org markup.</strong> </p>
  <p>This search is intended to help find sites using schema.org / LRMI, rather than use LRMI to help find resources.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Search for a common word (e.g. 'the') and then use the filters to find pages that contain that word and one or any of the LRMI terms in schema.org.</li>
    <li>Can be used with a tool such as the <a href="http://osds.openlinksw.com/">OpenLink Structured Data Sniffer</a> (OSDS) to show how the LRMI properties are being used the pages at urls returned.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p><strong>The search is brittle</strong> in a number of ways, notably the number of results is over-reported. Separate to this some of the results returned do not currently contain the LRMI you might think it does.</p>
<p><strong>Searches for properties in microdata and RDFa only</strong>, will not find LRMI being used in JSON-LD.</p>
